Rules
=====


Stat line
---------

Power, Finesse and Will are Core Stats.

**Power**: Used for attacking and defending in melee, defending against ranged attacks.

**Finesse**: Used for ranged attacks and modifies movement.

**Will**: Used for casting spells and morale.

**Health**: A models health shows how much damage it can take before it collapses, is killed or incapacitated. 10-20

**Armour**: Armour indicates how much damage the model reduces incoming damage with.


Skills (Not used in Version 2)
------

Difficulties when performing a skill check are easy 6+, normal 11+, hard 16+. To roll a skill check simply roll 1D20 and get equal or higher than the difficulty. If no difficulty is written use the normal difficulty of 11+.

### Power

### Finesse

Spot hidden

### Will

Leadership


Setup the battle
----------------

To setup a game of Storm of Istra, you need at least two players for Player versus Player (PVP) and at least one player and one Game Master for Player versus Environment (PVE).

Each participant rolls initiative to see who goes first. A simple opposed roll using 1D20 is used, the high roller begins, ties are rerolled. If there are more than two players they can in roll off to see who goes next or just use the standard board game rule, the next player to the left goes after the winner in a circle.

### Deploying your mercenary company

There is a standard way to deploy your models, but some scenarios may change those.

#### Standard Deployment

The player that won the Initiative gets to deploy one of his models, then the next player deploys one model, and so on until all models have been placed on the board.


The Turn
--------

Games are divided into turns, each player will have a chance to move all of their figures on a turn.

### Initiative

The player that won the roll get to activate one of his models and then nominate the next model to be activated.

The player can choose to nominate their own, another player's models or a neutral monster's model.

The owner of the nominated model takes that model's turn and then nominates the next model, and so forth until all models have been nominated once.

The last nominated model’s player nominates the first model for the next turn.

### Activation

When a model is activated it has to take its round, it can't hold its action or ready them for later.

A model has one Movement action and one Standard action, they can take them in any order.

Valid Movement actions: Move, Pick up item and Switch weapon.

Valid Standard actions: Melee, Shoot, Cast a spell, Sprint.

Sometimes a model may be eligible for a Reaction, a special type of Action, spending her actions on another models turn.


Movement actions
----------------

If a model wants to move take 4 and adds it Finesse stat, it may move that many inches.

### Move

#### Obstructions or rough terrain

If a model wants to move through rough terrain such as rubble or scale a building it may do so at 1" at the cost of 2".

#### Climbing

A model can climb 3” during any part of its movement, climbing still cost movement. Climbing in obstructions or rough terrain still applies. Enemies always have the *First strike* special rule against models that have climbed this turn.

#### Forced engaged in combat

If a model moves within 1" of an enemy, they are considered Engaged in combat and are moved into base-contact.

#### Disengage from combat

To run away from a combat, the model must succeed at a Disengage-roll. Roll 1T20 and if the result is 11+ the model may Disengage from the combat and move. The model gains -1 to the Disengage roll for each enemy it's engaged with beyond the first.

#### Moved by a spell

If a model is moved by a spell such as Teleport they are not considered having moved. The rules for Forced engaged in combat still applies.

#### Moving of the board

If a model moves of the board it may not return.

#### Falling

A model may jump down from 3" without sustaining any injuries. If the model falls more than 3" it suffers damage equal to the number of inches fall multiplied by 1.5 (round down), armour does not apply to fall damage.

### Pick up item

You may spend your Movement action to pick up an item.

### Switch weapon

You may spend your Movement action to switch to another weapon that you have equipped.


Standard actions
----------------

### Sprint

If a model wants to sprint it must have already moved this turn, it may then move half of its movement.

### Melee

A model may attack another model that it's in base-contact with.

Both figures roll 1D20 and add their Power stat, plus any other modifiers that are relevant. The figure with the highest total may inflict damage on the opponent.

Damage is determined by subtracting the losers armour from the total of the winner. If it's zero or negative, then no damage is caused.

If damage was caused reduce the loser's health stat by that much and lower one Core Stat by 1.

If both sides totals are the same then both are considered winners and may inflict damage.

### Shoot

A model may attack another model with its ranged weapon if it's both in range and in line-of-sight.

The attacker rolls 1D20 and add their Finesse stat, plus any other modifiers that are relevant. The defender rolls 1D20 and add their Power stat, plus any other modifiers that are relevant.

If the attacker's total is equal or higher than the defender's total, the attacker is the winner and may deal damage by subtracting the loser's armour stat from its total. If it's zero or negative, then no damage is caused.

If damage was caused reduce the loser's health stat by that much and lower one Core Stat by 1.

### Cast a spell

A model may cast a spell if they fulfil the spells requirements such as range, legal target, etc.

If the spell is an attack spell the caster rolls 1D20 and add their Will stat, plus any other modifiers that are relevant. The defender rolls 1D20 and add the Defence stat associated with that spell, plus any other modifiers that are relevant.

If it's another type of spell the caster rolls 1D20 and add their Will stat, plus any other modifiers that are relevant against the spells Target number.

If the caster's total is equal or higher than the defender's total, the caster is the winner and may apply the spell effect.

If damage was caused reduce the loser's health stat by that much and lower one Core Stat by 1.

If the caster loses he may suffer damage according to the spell failure table

#### Spell failure

| Amount By Which Casting Roll Failed | Damage Taken by Spellcaster |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1–4                                 | None                        |
| 5–9                                 | 1 Damage                    |
| 10–19                               | 2 Damage                    |
| 20+                                 | 5 Damage                    |


Range
-----

### High above

Shooting from higher up adds to the range of Ranged weapons. Measure the height difference between the attacker and the defender and add it to the range of the attackers Ranged weapon.

For example, an archer is standing 3" above her target adds 3" to her bows maximum range.


Damage
------

### Health

If a models Health is reduced to zero, they are considered to be out of the game. Take the model away from the board and set it aside in a special area for models taken out of battle.

### Core Stat

If all of a models Core Stats are reduced to zero, they are considered to be out of the game. Take the model away from the board and set it aside in a special area for models taken out of the game.

When a model takes damage to Core Stats it's the stat that was rolled that first takes damage, if that Core Stat is already zero reduce the next Core Stat in line by 1.

> A model has \[1P, 2F, 1W\], it takes 2F damage, then it takes another 1F damage but now the models Finesse is already zero, so the damage goes to the next Core Stat in line, Will, it takes 1 damage to Will. The model now has Core Stats as follows \[1P, 0F, 0W\]. If it takes any damage to either Finesse or Will it will carry over to Power, reducing it down to zero and taking the model out of game.


Morale
------

If a model has 4 Health left she must start making Morale checks at the start of its activation. She rolls 1D20 and adds her Will stat plus any other relevant modifiers, against the target number 10 plus 1 for each Health lost.

If the roll is equal or higher than the target number she may remain in the battle as normal.

If the roll is lower than the target number she will flee using both her Move and Sprint action to get to the nearest table edge. She takes the safest way away from enemies.


Critical Hit
------------

When a model making an attack rolls a natural twenty (20), then they have scored a critical hit. It automatically wins that combat and may deal double damage (after armour reduction).


Critical Fumble
---------------

When a model making an attack rolls a natural one (1), then they have scored a critical fumble. It automatically loses that combat, reduces one Core Stat by 1 and its opponent may deal damage (Effective Core Stat loss is two, one for the fumble and one for the damage). If the model was shooting into a melee combat, reroll the attack against one of the models allies in that combat.


Advantage & Disadvantage
------------------------

A model may have advantage or disadvantage to her rolls.

When it has advantage roll two D20 and take the highest result.

When it has disadvantage roll two D20 and take the lowest result.

Each Advantage cancels out one Disadvantage.

A model can never get more than two dice to roll from either advantage or disadvantage.

### Advantage

#### Flanked

If a model has at least one ally fighting with him against one opponent, it gains advantage.

#### Shooting at a Large target

If a model wants to shoot at a Large target it gains advantage.

### Disadvantage

#### Shooting into melee

If a model wants to shoot into a melee combat it gains disadvantage. This also applies to ranged attack spells.

#### Cover

If a model shoots at an enemy that has cover it gains disadvantage.

A spellcaster may choose a number of spells equal to his level.

## Henchmen?
